# 99 Bars
This is a straightforward puzzle game developed in React Native, conceived as an exercise to recreate an original version crafted in Kotlin several months prior.

# When was it created?
The inception of the original project dates back to January 3, 2021, with the last update recorded on May 20, 2021. Subsequently, the project remained dormant on my SSD for an extended period.

# Why is it being shared now?
Recently, intending to assist a friend with his UX and front-end portfolio, I decided to unearth this unfinished project. The goal was to explore its potential applicability for him and his school project.

# Okay, but how does it work?
Essentially, the game involves a 3x3 matrix with elements that can toggle between bars, rounds, and crosses. Upon starting the game, bars are initially displayed. When you tap on the bars, they transform into rounds. However, if you fail to touch the bars in time, they evolve into crosses, marking the end of the game.
The objective of the game is to tap all the bars before they transition into crosses. It's a timing-based challenge where success hinges on speed and agility. To emerge victorious, players must swiftly touch each bar presented before it transforms crosses.
